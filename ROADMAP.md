# Roadmap

Future features and improvements for Early MCP Server. Contributions and feedback welcome!

## Planned

### Security
- [ ] **Keychain/credential manager support** - Optional secure storage for API keys using system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) instead of environment variables

### Multi-Account
- [ ] **Account switching** - Manage multiple Early accounts in same session, useful for team administrators who need to access and report on employee time data

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **Verbose/debug mode** - Better logging for troubleshooting

## Ideas (Need Feedback)

These might be useful but need validation:

- **Offline queue** - Buffer commands when API is unreachable, sync when back online
- **CSV export tool** - Dedicated tool that outputs report data as CSV (vs Claude formatting it)
